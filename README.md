# Color to recommendation 
A recommender system that sorts a spotify playlist using emotions as a medium between colors and music.

** Psychological groundtruth 
The underlying psychological thoughts describe a strong connection between the emotions delivered by music and colors. Emotions function as a medium and can be 
translated into both directions. Synesthesia is a perceptual phenomen in which simulation of one sensory or cognitive pathway leads to involuntary experiences in a 
second sensory or cognitive pathway. Psychologists see synesthesia as a spectrum. The sources cited in this work are not dealing with the perception of people deep 
on the synesthetic spectrum, but rather the perception of people without noticeable synesthetic abilities.
